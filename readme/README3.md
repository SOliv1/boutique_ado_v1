## Stripes Part 2
Go to:
    https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment#web-collect-card-details
    get the javascript details and paste in check_out.html in corejs script at top and at the bottom of template - 
    save and inspect values for values. Public key matches secret.client key. 
    get basic styles from the stripe js Docs.  Update the default colour of the element to black.
    And I'll change the invalid colour to match bootstraps text danger class.
    I can also get some CSS for our actual CSS file from the stripe documentation
    which I'll paste in here.
